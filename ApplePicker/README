# ApplePicker Game

Welcome to **ApplePicker**, a fun and engaging game where you catch apples in a basket while avoiding deadly poison apples! The game progressively gets harder, challenging your reflexes and decision-making skills.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Move the basket left and right to **catch falling apples**.
- **Golden apples** give bonus points.
- **Poison apples** should be avoided – catching them will **remove a life**.
- The game ends when all baskets (lives) are lost.
- Try to set the **highest score** possible!

## 🛠 Unique Features
✅ **Golden Apples** – Rare golden apples worth **300 points** instead of the usual 100.
✅ **Poison Apples** – Catching these will **remove a basket**, but missing them does **no penalty**.
✅ **Game Over Screen** – Displays the final score and high score, allowing you to restart.
✅ **Start Menu** – A dedicated start screen with a clean UI before the game begins.
✅ **Increasing Difficulty** – Apples fall faster as the game progresses, making it more challenging.
✅ **Smooth Controls** – Easy-to-use controls for a seamless gaming experience.
✅ **Non-Fullscreen Window** – Runs in windowed mode for easy quitting (no forced fullscreen).

# ApplePicker Game

Welcome to ApplePicker, a fun and engaging game where you catch apples in a basket while avoiding deadly poison apples! The game progressively gets harder, challenging your reflexes and decision-making skills.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Move the basket left and right to catch falling apples.
- Golden apples give bonus points.
- Poison apples should be avoided – catching them will remove a life.
- The game ends when all baskets (lives) are lost.
- Try to set the highest score possible!

## 🛠 Unique Features
- ✅ Golden Apples – Rare golden apples worth **300 points** instead of the usual 100.
- ✅ Poison Apples – Catching these will **remove a basket**, but missing them does **no penalty**.
- ✅ Game Over Screen – Displays the final score and high score, allowing you to restart.
- ✅ Start Menu – A dedicated start screen with a clean UI before the game begins.
- ✅ Increasing Difficulty – Apples fall faster as the game progresses, making it more challenging.
- ✅ Smooth Controls – Easy-to-use controls for a seamless gaming experience.
- ✅ Non-Fullscreen Window – Runs in windowed mode for easy quitting (no forced fullscreen).

## 🔥 Play the Game
### **Download the Build Folder**
You can download the full build directly from the `Builds/` folder in this repository.

### **Important:**
The game cannot be run using just the `.exe` file. You must download and keep the entire `Builds` folder together, as it contains essential files like `UnityPlayer.dll` and the `*_Data` folder.

**To play:**
1. Download and extract the `Builds` folder.
2. Open the folder and run `ApplePickerGame.exe`.
3. Enjoy!
